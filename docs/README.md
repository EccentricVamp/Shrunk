# Honey, I shunk the player

Adds keybindings for shrinking (and unshrinking) yourself to 1/5th scale.

By default, the keys are unbound. You'll need to configure them.

This is a utility mod I made for myself to help with cable routing and such.

Depends on [Pehkui](https://github.com/Virtuoel/Pehkui)
